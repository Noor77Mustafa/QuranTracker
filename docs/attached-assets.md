# Removed Attached Assets

The `attached_assets/` directory previously contained large images, PDFs, and text notes generated during early development and debugging. These files were not part of the application code and caused the repository to be unnecessarily heavy.

To keep the project lightweight and focused, the directory has been removed from version control. If any of the removed materials are needed for reference, they can be accessed from previous commits.
