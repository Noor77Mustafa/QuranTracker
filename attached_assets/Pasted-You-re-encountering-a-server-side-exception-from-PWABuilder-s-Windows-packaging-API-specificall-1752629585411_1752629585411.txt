You're encountering a **server-side exception from PWABuilder's Windows packaging API**, specifically during the **generation of Windows 11 assets** for your PWA:

---

### ‚ùå Error Summary

```
System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode()
```

This is triggered inside:

```
Microsoft.PWABuilder.Windows.Chromium.Services.ImageGenerator.CreateWindows11ImagesZip
```

üîç Meaning: The request sent to the **image generator** failed (e.g., 404 or 500), and `.EnsureSuccessStatusCode()` threw an exception because the HTTP response status was **not 2xx**.

---

### ‚úÖ Most Likely Cause

**Your PWA's manifest or image(s) are incompatible or inaccessible**, specifically:

* The **icon URL** listed in your `manifest.json` might:

  * Be **invalid**, **insecure** (non-HTTPS), or **non-public**
  * Point to an image **too small** or **wrong MIME type**
  * Return a **404** or **redirect** that the image service can‚Äôt handle

---

### üîç How to Fix It

1. **Open your manifest**:
   Visit:
   [`https://quran-tracker-noormustafa4.replit.app/manifest.webmanifest`](https://quran-tracker-noormustafa4.replit.app/manifest.webmanifest)

2. **Check the `"icons"` array**, e.g.:

```json
"icons": [
  {
    "src": "/icon.png",
    "sizes": "192x192",
    "type": "image/png"
  }
]
```

3. **Ensure**:

   * The icon exists: test with `https://quran-tracker-noormustafa4.replit.app/icon.png`
   * It's at least **512√ó512 pixels** for Windows packaging
   * It's accessible from outside (not blocked or restricted)
   * It's served via **HTTPS**

4. **Try replacing with a direct HTTPS icon URL** (for testing):

```json
"icons": [
  {
    "src": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bitmap_Icon_example.png",
    "sizes": "512x512",
    "type": "image/png"
  }
]
```

### ‚úÖ Rebuild on [pwabuilder.com](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)

Once you've updated the manifest:

1. Revisit your PWA URL on PWABuilder.
2. Click **"Publish" ‚Üí "Windows"**.
3. Try generating the `.msix` package again.

Would you like help validating your manifest.json or want me to generate a valid one for Windows 11 support?
