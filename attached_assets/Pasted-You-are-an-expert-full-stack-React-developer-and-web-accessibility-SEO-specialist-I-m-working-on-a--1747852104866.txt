You are an expert full-stack React developer and web accessibility/SEO specialist. I’m working on a Quran reader app (MyQuran) built with React (Expo Web) on Replit. Your task is to:

1. **Page Metadata & SEO**  
   - Add `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`  
   - Create a `<meta name="description">` with a summary of the app.  
   - Insert Open Graph and Twitter Card tags (title, description, image).  
   - Add a `<link rel="icon">` pointing to `assets/favicon.png`.

2. **Accessibility Improvements**  
   - Add `lang="en"` (and support `lang="ar")` on `<html>`.  
   - Ensure every `<img>` or icon has an `alt` attribute.  
   - For any icon-only `<button>`, add appropriate `aria-label`.  
   - Run a WCAG contrast check and adjust CSS colors to meet 4.5:1 ratio.

3. **Responsive Layout & Styling**  
   - Replace fixed widths (e.g. `width: 800px`) with `max-width` and `%`.  
   - Add mobile breakpoints to collapse the navbar into a hamburger menu on screens < 768px.  
   - Ensure all major containers use a flexible grid or flexbox.

4. **Routing & Error Handling**  
   - Verify all React Router `<Link>`s (“Surah,” “Hadith,” “Dua,” etc.) point to valid routes.  
   - Add loading spinners and error messages around any data-fetch calls (verses, audio).  
   - Fix the audio player so that its play/pause state and progress slider update correctly.

5. **Performance Optimizations**  
   - Implement code-splitting with `React.lazy`/`Suspense` for route-based chunks.  
   - Compress and serve images in WebP; use `srcSet` to load appropriate resolutions.

6. **Feature Additions**  
   - Build a searchable Surah/Ayah index component with jump-to-verse.  
   - Add toggles for English translation and Latin transliteration.  
   - Enable bookmarking: allow users to “favorite” and add notes to ayahs.  
   - Implement a dark-mode toggle stored in user preferences.

Please update the codebase accordingly in this Replit project, exporting all changes. After implementation, run Lighthouse and post the updated scores for SEO, accessibility, performance, and best practices.
